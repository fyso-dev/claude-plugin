# Fyso Limitations — Known Issues & Workarounds

This document lists known Fyso platform limitations that affect planning, building, and verification. The designer, builder, and verifier agents MUST read this before operating.

## Critical Limitations

### 1. field_change triggers don't fire from updateDataDirect

**Impact:** High
**Affects:** Business rules with `triggerType: "field_change"`

When a `after_save` action uses `updateDataDirect` to modify a record, `field_change` triggers on the target entity do NOT fire. This means computed fields won't update.

**Workaround:**
- Use `before_save` triggers for critical validations
- For compute chains, put all computations in a single rule that fires `before_save`
- If you need cross-entity updates, use `after_save` actions but be aware that computed fields on the target entity won't recalculate automatically

**Planning impact:** When designing business rules, prefer `before_save` for validations. Only use `field_change` for UI-triggered computations where the user directly edits the field.

### 2. MCP session can lose tenant context

**Impact:** Medium
**Affects:** All MCP operations

The MCP session may lose the selected tenant between calls, especially in long-running sessions or after errors.

**Workaround:**
- Always call `select_tenant` at the start of each task
- If an operation fails with a "no tenant selected" error, re-select and retry once

**Planning impact:** Every plan task should start with `select_tenant` as its first operation.

### 3. Semantic search requires OPENAI_API_KEY + embedding worker

**Impact:** Medium
**Affects:** Channel tools using `operation: "semantic_search"`

Semantic search won't work unless:
1. `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in the environment
2. The embedding worker is running and has indexed the entity's records

**Workaround:**
- Use `operation: "query"` with text filters instead of semantic search
- Or confirm embeddings are configured before planning semantic search tools

**Planning impact:** Don't plan semantic search channel tools without confirming the prerequisites.

### 4. Channel slugs are global and non-reusable

**Impact:** Medium
**Affects:** Channel creation and naming

Once a channel slug is used and then deleted, that slug cannot be reused. It's burned forever.

**Workaround:**
- Choose channel names carefully
- Use descriptive, specific names (e.g., "consultorio-fono-api" not "api")
- Don't create test channels with production names

**Planning impact:** Plan channel names as part of the design phase. Don't use temporary names.

### 5. Published entities with data resist schema changes

**Impact:** High
**Affects:** Entity modification after data exists

Once an entity is published and has records, modifying its schema (adding required fields, changing types, removing fields) becomes risky:
- Adding a required field will fail if existing records don't have a value
- Changing field types can corrupt existing data
- Removing fields loses data

**Workaround:**
- Design fields completely before publishing
- Use the "create draft → configure → test → publish" flow
- If you must modify a published entity, export data first, then modify, then re-import

**Planning impact:** Plans should create all fields before publishing. Business rules should be created and tested before publishing the entity.

### 6. Compute chains must be in correct order within a single rule

**Impact:** Medium
**Affects:** Business rules with multiple computed fields

If field B depends on field A (e.g., `tax = subtotal * 0.21`, `total = subtotal + tax`), both computations must be in the same rule DSL, and `subtotal` must be defined before `tax`, and `tax` before `total` in the `compute` object.

**Workaround:**
- Always order compute fields by dependency in the DSL
- Test the compute chain with `test_business_rule` to verify order

**Planning impact:** When designing rules with compute chains, specify the exact field order in the plan.

### 7. generate_entity vs create_entity + create_field

**Impact:** Low
**Affects:** Entity creation approach

`generate_entity` creates an entity with all fields in one call. There is no separate `create_entity` + `create_field` flow in the MCP.

**Workaround:** Use `generate_entity` with the complete field list.

**Planning impact:** Plans should use `generate_entity` with the full field definition, not individual field creation calls.

### 8. Business rule DSL expression limitations

**Impact:** Low
**Affects:** Complex expressions in rules

The expression parser has some limitations:
- No string interpolation (use concatenation if available)
- Limited date arithmetic (prefer simple comparisons)
- No array operations
- No external API calls from expressions

**Workaround:**
- Keep expressions simple
- Break complex logic into multiple simpler rules
- Use `conditional` type for branching logic

**Planning impact:** Design rules with simple, testable expressions. Avoid complex date math.

## Non-Issues (Things That Work Fine)

- Creating multiple entities in sequence — works reliably
- Creating business rules after entity is published — works
- Relations between published entities — work correctly
- `query_records` with filters — works as expected
- `export_metadata` / `import_metadata` — reliable for snapshots
- Custom fields survive metadata imports — preserved correctly
